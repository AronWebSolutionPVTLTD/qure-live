                                <p>Here’s how it works: you order, we process, then we ship. Ordering takes a few
                                    seconds. Processing takes 1 to 3 business days (and orders placed after 9am ET
                                    are
                                    processed the next business day). Then one of our carriers takes it from there.
                                    You’ll
                                    get a shipment notification email with a tracking number as soon as your package
                                    ships
                                    and it’s on the way!</p>
